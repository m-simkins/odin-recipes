Iteration 4: add more recipes
-Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you’ve already created.
-Don’t forget to link to the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren’t all on one line.
-Example:
 <ul>
    <li><a href="recipes/yourrecipe.html">Recipe Title 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="recipes/yourrecipe.html">Recipe Title 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="recipes/yourrecipe.html">Recipe Title 3</a></li>
  </ul>
Your links won’t be flashy, but for now, just focus on building them out.
